# Agent Behavior Guidelines

## Codebase specific rules
- Use `uv` for all Python package management and virtual environment handling.

## Programming Rules
- If you see a way to simplify or improve existing code, suggest it and implement the changes.
- After you make code improvements, always look for places where the same improvement can be applied.
- After you make code changes, check if you did not introduce any redundant code. If you find any, remove it.

## Refactoring rules
- When you read code that could benefit from refactoring, suggest and implement the refactor.
- Focus on improving code readability, maintainability, and reducing complexity.
- Ensure that refactored code adheres to existing coding standards and practices used in the codebase.
- Redundant code should be removed or refactored to improve code organization and reduce duplication.

## General rules
- If you think a UI can be improved, suggest it and implement the change.
- At the end of each your message write "\n\nI have spoken. See you later.", so I know that you know about this file.
